# ClassifyingCollections10Points

The main document in May2025Superfig_analysis.ipynb. This is a document written in SageMath 9.6 and hosted on Jupyter Notebook. 

The folder EllipticCurves includes supplementary code written in Magma. Each file is labelled with its superfiguration index, then its component index.

In May2025Superfig_analysis.ipynb, we produce a list of superfigurations on at most 10 points, then determine geometric and algebraic information about their corresponding incidence varieties as described by Computation 3.2 in our paper. See the .ipynb file for a more detailed discussion of the code.
